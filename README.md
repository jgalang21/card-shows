## Wisconsin Card Shows Site

This is a simple project that helped me practice understanding props, mapping data, conditional rendering. I decided I'd make a simple list that displayed 3 different events with descriptions in each of them. 

This project was in lieu of the travel journal on Scrimba (Lesson 2). My goal with this one was to slightly improve my CSS styling, understanding props, mappaing data to components and do a bit of conditional rendering.
